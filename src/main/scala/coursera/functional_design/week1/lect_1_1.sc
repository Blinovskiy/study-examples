//      B1
//    /   \
//  B2 -- B3
//Solution: We must remove duplicate authors who are in the results
//  list twice.
//This is achieved using the distinct method on sequences:
  { for {
    b1 <- books
    b2 <- books
    if b1.title < b2.title
    a1 <- b1.authors
    a2 <- b2.authors
    if a1 == a2
  } yield a1
  }.distinct



//Better alternative: Compute with sets instead of sequences:
val bookSet = books.toSet
for {
  b1 <- bookSet
  b2 <- bookSet
  if b1 != b2
  a1 <- b1.authors
  a2 <- b2.authors
  if a1 == a2
} yield a1
